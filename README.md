## Usage:
1. Set a target directory
2. Select your Meshes, then lastly the rig. 
3. Run the export using one of the buttons (There will be no popup window or confirmation dialog)


## Export Options:
### A: Export without animations: 

Useful where you just want to export a blank rigged character, maybe because you want to link the animations externally.

            
### B: Export with Active Animation:

Exports the rig only with the currently active action/animation. Useful if you want to export animations as seperate FBX files.

### C: Export with All Animations

The default export behavior. All actions are included in the exported file.
